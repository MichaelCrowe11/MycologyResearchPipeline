## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Docstrings for all public functions/classes (Google style)

**Example:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def analyze_sample(
    image_path: str,
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.7,
    databases: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> dict:
    """Analyze a mushroom sample image.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the image file.
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence for predictions.
        databases: List of databases to query. Defaults to all.
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If image_path is invalid.
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features
- Semicolons required
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`

### CSS/SCSS Style Guide

- Use BEM naming convention
- Mobile-first approach
- CSS variables for theming

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Test file naming: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

**Example:**
```python
import pytest
from app import create_app
from models import User

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app = create_app(testing=True)
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_user_registration(client):
    """Test user registration endpoint."""
    response = client.post('/api/auth/register', json={
        'email': 'test@example.com',
        'password': 'SecurePass123!',
        'name': 'Test User'
    })
    
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert 'access_token' in response.json
```
